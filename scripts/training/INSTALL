This script describes how to setup and use the Joshua pipeline.pl
script.

== DEPENDENCIES ======================================================

The Joshua pipeline has the following external dependencies:

- Hadoop (0.20.2)
  http://www.apache.org/dist//hadoop/common/hadoop-0.20.2/hadoop-0.20.2.tar.gz

  Hadoop is used by Thrax for extracting Hiero- and SAMT-style grammars.

- Thrax
  http://cs.jhu.edu/~jonny/thrax/

In the near future (summer 2011), both Thrax and Hadoop will be
distributed with Joshua, but for now you will have to install them
yourself.

In addition, Joshua depends on the following externally-developed
software, which is included with the Joshua distribution:

- The Berkeley Aligner (2.1)
  http://berkeleyaligner.googlecode.com/files/berkeleyaligner_unsupervised-2.1.tar.gz

- Berkeley Parser
  http://code.google.com/p/berkeleyparser/source/checkout

  (Only used if you extract SAMT grammars)

== INSTALLATION ======================================================

0. If it is not already installed, download and install Hadoop version
   0.20.0 .  You may find the following document useful in setting up
   a single-machine instance of Hadoop:

   http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/single_node_setup.html
   http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/GettingStartedWithHadoop

   Make sure the following two environment variables are defined:

   export HADOOP_VERSION="0.20.2"
   export HADOOP=/path/to/hadoop-0.20.2

0. Download and install Thrax.  Define the following environment
   variable:

    export THRAX=/path/to/thrax

1. Download and install Joshua.  

   The best way to do this is to use git to clone the latest
   stable release of the codebase:

     git clone git@github.com:joshua-decoder/joshua.git

   Then compile it:

     cd joshua
     ant jar
