This script describes how to setup and use the Joshua pipeline.pl
script.

== DEPENDENCIES ======================================================

The Joshua pipeline has the following external dependencies:

- Moses scripts (for running GIZA)
  This dependency will be removed in the near future, in favor of the
  Berkeley aligner.

- Hadoop (for extracting grammars)

- Berkeley Parser (for parsing for SAMT grammars)

== INSTALLATION ======================================================
