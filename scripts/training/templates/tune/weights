## Model weights #####################################################

# For each langage model line listed above, create a weight in the
# following format: the keyword "lm", a 0-based index, and the weight.
# lm INDEX WEIGHT

<LMWEIGHTS>

# The phrasal weights correspond to weights stored with each of the
# grammar rules.  The format is
#
#   phrasemodel owner COLUMN WEIGHT
#
# where COLUMN denotes the 0-based order of the parameter in the
# grammar file and WEIGHT is the corresponding weight.  In the future,
# we plan to add a sparse feature representation which will simplify
# this.

<TMWEIGHTS>

PhraseModel_glue_0 1.0

# The wordpenalty feature counts the number of words in each hypothesis.

WordPenalty -1.0

# This feature counts the number of unknown words in the hypothesis.

OOVPenalty -100

# This feature weights paths through an input lattice.  It is only activated
# when decoding lattices.
