3.2 (stable)
=================================

- Pop-limit pruning.

  Pruning can now be specified with a single parameter "pop-limit"
  parameter, which limits the number of pops from the cube pruning
  candidate list at the span level.  This replaces the beam and
  threshold pruning that was governed by four parameters (fuzz1,
  fuzz2, relative_threshold, and max_n_rules), whose performance and
  interaction was somewhat difficult to characterize.  The pop-limit
  allows a simple relationship between decoding time and model score
  to be defined.

  Setting "pop-limit" in the configuration file or from the command
  line turns off beam-and-threshold pruning, and its use is
  recommended.  The default setting is to use a pop-limit of 100.

- Multiple language model support

  You can now specify an arbitrary number of language models.  See the
  documentation in

    $JOSHUA/scripts/training/templates/mert/joshua.config 

  for information on how to do this.  You can also specify multiple
  --lmfile flags to the pipeline.pl script.

- Multiple optimizer + test runs (--optimizer-runs N), averaging the
  results at the end (Clark et al., ACL 2011)

- Added support for BerkeleyLM (Pauls and Klein, ACL 2011)

- Support for lattice decoding (thanks to Lane Schwartz and the
  miniSCALE 2012 team)

- Pipeline script:

  - Removed all external dependencies (e.g., Moses, SRILM)

  - Reorganized the training data

  - Permit multiple test runs with subsequent --test FILE --name NAME
    calls to the pipeline

  - GIZA++ runs are parallelized if more than one thread is permitted
    (--threads N, N >=2 )

  - Numerous bugfixes

  - Hadoop cluster rollout is now a single instance (slower but
    doesn't require error-prone server setup)

- Parameters

  - Joshua now dies if it encounters unknown parameters on the command
    line or config file

  - Parameters are now normalized to remove hyphens (-) and
    underscores (_) and to flatten case, permitting you to specify any
    of, for example, {pop-limit, popLimit, pop_limit, ...}

- Lots of reorganization and purging of old code


3.1 
=============================

- Fixed multithreading.  Use -threads N from the command line or
  configuration file to spawn N parallel decoding threads.

- Configuration file parameters can now be overridden from the command
  line.  The format is

  -parameter value

  Among these must be the configuration file itself, which can be
  referred to with -config, or -c for short.

3.0
===

- Added the highly parameterizable Hadoop-based Thrax grammar
  extractor, which extracts both Hiero and SAMT grammars.

- Incorporated a black-box pipeline script at
  $JOSHUA/scripts/training/pipeline.pl

- Moved development to github.com.
