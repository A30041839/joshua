food : where european inflation slipped up
the skyward zoom in food prices is the dominant force behind the speed up in eurozone inflation .
november price hikes were higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries , with october 's 2.6 percent yr / yr inflation rate followed by 3.1 percent in november , the eu 's luxembourg-based statistical office reported .
official forecasts predicted just 3 percent , bloomberg said .
as opposed to the us , uk , and canadian central banks , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- did not cut interest rates , arguing that a rate drop combined with rising raw material prices and declining unemployment would trigger an inflationary spiral .
the ecb wants to hold inflation to under two percent , or somewhere in that vicinity .
according to one analyst , ecb a has been caught in a catch-22 : it needs to `` talk down '' inflation , to keep from having to take action to push it down later in the game .
germany 's november inflation rate of 3.3 percent counts as a record ; in spain the rate shot up to 4.1 percent from an earlier 3.6 .
soaring food and energy prices sent eurozone inflation into the stratosphere .
wheat futures were up by 88 percent and soybean prices were at their highest since 1973 .
