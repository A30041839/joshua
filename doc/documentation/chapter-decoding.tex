Assumption: The grammar contains no epsilon rules.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Extend the dot chart
\item Populate complete rules into the chart, as in regular CKY
\item Process unary rules (e.g., S $\rightarrow$ X, NP $\rightarrow$ NN), just add these items in chart, assume the rule set is acyclic
\item 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Extend the dot chart}

Attempt to combine an item in the dot chart
with an item in the chart to create a new item
in the dot chart.

In other words, this method looks 
for (proved) theorems or axioms in the completed chart
that may apply and extend the dot position.

You can think of an item in the dot chart as a pointer into the grammar trie, plus some history data.


\section{Populate completed chart}

The grammar is assumed to be stored as a trie data structure. Each node in the trie may contain a list of translation rules.

Populate complete rules into the chart, as in regular CKY

Pruning, feature function evaluation, and creation of hypergraph all take place in this step



\section{Process unary rules}

Process unary rules (e.g., S $\rightarrow$ X, NP $\rightarrow$ NN), just add these items in chart, assume the rule set is acyclic.

This step uses an agenda parsing approach.
