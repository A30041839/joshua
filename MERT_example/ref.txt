Scientists in the early dementia and death for the completion of the sequencing of chromosome
(Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd) - International group of scientists said they have been the 14th human chromosome to the completion of the sequencing, which pairs of chromosomes with a number of diseases, including the 30-year-old who may be suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer Zi Alzheimer's disease.
This is the date of completion of the sequencing of the fourth chromosome, which is more than 87,000,000 pairs of DNA (dna) component.
Britain's Natural Science magazine published the study showed that on the 14th chromosome sequencing by the 1050 genes and gene fragments pose.
Gene scientists aim is to provide diagnostic tools to detect the pathogenic gene defects, which in the end to prevent the provision of these disorders have a genetic therapy.
