### Commonly used parameters
-dir	MERT_example            # working directory (i.e. location of relevant files)
-s	src.txt                 # source sentences file name
-r	ref                     # target sentences file name (in this case, file name prefix)
-rps	4                       # references per sentence
-p	params.txt              # parameter file
-maxIt	2                       # maximum MERT iterations
-ipi	5                       # number of intermediate initial points per iteration
-cmd	decoder_command_ex2.txt # file containing command to run decoder
-decOut	nbest_ex2.out           # file prodcued by decoder
-dcfg	config_ex2.txt          # decoder config file
-N	300                     # size of N-best list generated each iteration
-v	2                       # verbosity level (0-2; higher value => more verbose)
-seed   12341234                # random number generator seed

# Notice that comments are allowed

### Other parameters (run MERT_runner with no arguments for default values)
#-fin     # output file for final values
#-m       # name of evaluation metric
#-minIt   # minimum MERT iterations before considering an early exit
#-prevIt  # previous MERT iterations from which to consider candidates (in addition to the current iteration)
#-stopSig # value over which a weight change is "significant" (for early exit purposes)
#-stopIt  # number of consecutive iterations an early exit criterion must be satisfied before actually exiting
#-save    # should MERT save intermediate config files or decoder output files? (or both? or neither?)
#-opi     # should MERT modify at most one parameter per iteration?
#-rand    # should first initial point (of first iteration) be initialized randomly?
#-decExit # return value by decoder indicating success
#-decV    # should decoder output be printed
